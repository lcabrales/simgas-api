[Monitoring System for Dangerous Gases Emitted During the Welding Process](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8596408)

Abstract:

Considering the art of joining two pieces of equal or different materials, as it is the welding, where certain gases are emitted in the process, it is important to have a gases detection system implemented and working. This need grows directly proportional to the number of non-welders, meaning those in the area for different reasons and do not possess or address the proper security measures. Because of the aforementioned situation, the potential risk of a highlevel gas exposure, inflammable or not, must be controlled. This is precisely the objective of the gas monitoring system. As a solution, a prototype is created for the monitoring system, directed at the welding workshops. This prototype includes an automated board or Arduino UNO processor, which provides the necessary connections and interactions for the sensors that capture and gather data used for analysis and to generate alerts of high-risk situations inside the welding workshop. A high concentration of the emitted gases captured by the sensors will cause the system to fire an alert, allowing the person responsible to take the appropriate security measures to prevent any permanent health damage for all people involved.[
